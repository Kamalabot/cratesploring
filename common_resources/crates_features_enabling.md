Yes, you're correct that in the `[features]` section of `Cargo.toml`, you can define different feature flags as keys, and each key can enable specific dependencies or additional functionality. If you have other features that need to be kept alongside the `gpu` feature, you can define multiple features and selectively combine them.

### Example of Combining Features in `Cargo.toml`:

Let's say you have additional features like `advanced_math` and `logging` that should also be optional, along with the `gpu` feature.

```toml
[package]
name = "your_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[features]
default = ["logging"]  # Default features enabled
gpu = ["cuda", "candle", "candle-nn"]  # GPU-related features
advanced_math = ["nalgebra", "ndarray"]  # Advanced math libraries
logging = ["log", "env_logger"]  # Logging functionality

[dependencies]
# Common dependencies
serde = "1.0"
anyhow = "1.0"

# GPU-specific dependencies (optional)
cuda = { version = "0.1", optional = true }
candle = { version = "0.1", optional = true }
candle-nn = { version = "0.1", optional = true }

# Advanced math dependencies (optional)
nalgebra = { version = "0.29", optional = true }
ndarray = { version = "0.15", optional = true }

# Logging dependencies (optional)
log = { version = "0.4", optional = true }
env_logger = { version = "0.9", optional = true }

# Add other dependencies as needed
```

### Building with Multiple Features:

You can enable multiple features at build time. For example:

- **On a GPU machine with advanced math and logging:**

```bash
cargo build --features "gpu,advanced_math,logging"
```

- **On a CPU-only machine but with advanced math:**

```bash
cargo build --features "advanced_math"
```

- **On a CPU-only machine with logging (default):**

```bash
cargo build
```

### Handling Conditional Logic for Multiple Features in Code:

In your Rust code, you can conditionally include or exclude sections based on multiple features.

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]
fn run_on_gpu() {
    // Code for GPU-based operations
}

#[cfg(feature = "advanced_math")]
fn perform_advanced_math() {
    // Code for advanced mathematical computations
}

#[cfg(feature = "logging")]
fn log_message() {
    // Logging code
}
```

This way, you can build a flexible project that adjusts functionality based on the environment and features selected. Let me know if you need further details!
