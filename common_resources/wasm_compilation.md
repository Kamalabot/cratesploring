The process for generating WebAssembly (Wasm) code involves the following steps: 

1. 1. Create a function
   
   A developer creates a function in a high-level language, such as C/C++, Rust, or Go 

2. 2. Compile the function
   
   A tool is used to compile the function into a Wasm binary file. Some tools that can be used include: 
   
   - Emscripten: Compiles C/C++ code into a Wasm binary and HTML/JS supporting code 
   
   - Wabt: Converts WebAssembly (`.wat`) written by hand into a binary format 
   
   - Wasm-pack: Used with a Rust application 
   
   - AssemblyScript: Provides a TypeScript-like experience 
   
   - Binaryen: A popular WebAssembly compiler toolchain that handles optimizations like dead-code removal and code folding 

3. 3. Send the file to a web client
   
   The Wasm file is sent to a web client that uses JavaScript's Wasm API to compile the binary 

4. 4. Instantiate the Wasm module
   
   The JavaScript instructions instantiate the Wasm module 

5. 5. Run the app
   
   The browser instantiates the Wasm module, memory, and table of references, allowing the app to run
