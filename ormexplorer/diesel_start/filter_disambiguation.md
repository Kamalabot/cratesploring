To disambiguate the method `std::iter::Iterator::filter` in the context of `show_posts.rs` in `diesel_demo`, you are likely dealing with a method name conflict between Diesel's query builder and Rust's standard library iterators.

This problem occurs because Diesel has its own `filter` method used for constructing SQL queries, and Rust’s standard library has a `filter` method for iterators. When both are in scope, Rust may not be able to infer which `filter` method you intend to use, causing ambiguity.

### Steps to Disambiguate the `filter` Method

1. **Use Full Path for Standard Library `filter`**:
   If you are trying to use the `filter` method from Rust’s `Iterator` trait, specify the full path to disambiguate between Diesel’s `filter` and `Iterator::filter`.
   
   ```rust
   use std::iter::Iterator;
   
   let posts = posts.into_iter().filter(|post| post.is_published);
   ```
   
   In this case, `into_iter()` is explicitly turning `posts` into an iterator, and `std::iter::Iterator::filter` is being used.

2. **Rename Diesel's `filter`**:
   If the conflict is coming from Diesel’s `filter` method and you want to use both `Iterator::filter` and Diesel’s `filter` in the same module, you can rename Diesel’s `filter` function upon import to avoid the ambiguity.
   
   ```rust
   use diesel::prelude::*;
   use diesel::dsl::filter as diesel_filter;
   ```
   
   This way, you can use `diesel_filter` for SQL filtering and `filter` for Rust’s iterator filtering.
   
   Example:
   
   ```rust
   use diesel::dsl::filter as diesel_filter;
   use std::iter::Iterator;
   
   let posts = diesel_filter(posts::table, posts::is_published.eq(true));
   let filtered_posts = posts.into_iter().filter(|post| post.is_published);
   ```

3. **Alternative Solution**:
   You can also resolve the ambiguity by using Diesel’s query builder `filter` directly in the query and iterating over the result set later using standard iterators.
   
   ```rust
   let posts = posts::table
       .filter(posts::is_published.eq(true))
       .load::<Post>(&connection)?;
   
   let filtered_posts: Vec<Post> = posts.into_iter().filter(|post| post.is_published).collect();
   ```

In this case, Diesel’s `filter` is used for constructing the query, and then you can apply the `std::iter::Iterator::filter` on the resulting `Vec<Post>` after the query is executed.

### Summary:

- **Disambiguation**: You can disambiguate the `filter` method by specifying the full path for `std::iter::Iterator::filter`, or rename Diesel’s `filter` during the import using `as`.
- **Use Both**: You can use both Diesel’s query builder `filter` and the iterator `filter` on the result set if needed, but you need to clarify which one you’re invoking in your code.

The error you're seeing, `cannot find -lpq: No such file or directory`, indicates that the linker is unable to find the PostgreSQL client library `libpq`. This library is required for projects using PostgreSQL, especially with Diesel.

Here’s how you can resolve it:

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. **Install PostgreSQL Development Libraries**:
   You need to install the PostgreSQL development package, which contains `libpq`. The package name depends on your system.
   
   - **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
     
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
     ```
   
   - **On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS**:
     
     ```bash
     sudo yum install postgresql-devel
     ```
   
   - **On Arch Linux**:
     
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S postgresql-libs
     ```
   
   This will install the necessary `libpq` files, including the headers and shared libraries needed for linking.

2. **Verify `libpq` Installation**:
   After installing the development libraries, you can check if `libpq` is present by searching for it in your library path:
   
   ```bash
   locate libpq.so
   ```
   
   It should show a path similar to `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpq.so`.

3. **Rebuild Your Project**:
   Once the libraries are installed, rebuild your project:
   
   ```bash
   cargo clean
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Ensure PostgreSQL is Installed**:
   Make sure that PostgreSQL itself is installed on your system. You can install PostgreSQL using the following commands:
   
   - **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
     
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install postgresql
     ```
   
   - **On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS**:
     
     ```bash
     sudo yum install postgresql
     ```
   
   - **On Arch Linux**:
     
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S postgresql
     ```

5. **Check `Cargo.toml` Dependencies**:
   Ensure that `diesel` is configured with PostgreSQL as a backend in your `Cargo.toml` file:
   
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   diesel = { version = "1.4", features = ["postgres"] }
   ```
   
   If you need Diesel CLI, install it with PostgreSQL support:
   
   ```bash
   cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
   ```

6. **Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)**:
   Sometimes, you might need to set the `LIBPQ_LIB_DIR` or `LIBPQ_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variables to point to the correct location of the libraries.
   
   Example:
   
   ```bash
   export LIBPQ_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
   export LIBPQ_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/postgresql
   ```

### Conclusion:

Installing the `libpq` development package should resolve the linker error. Once installed, ensure that PostgreSQL is properly set up and `diesel` is configured for the PostgreSQL backend in your `Cargo.toml`. Rebuild your project to complete the process.
